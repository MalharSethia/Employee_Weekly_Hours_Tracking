# Employee Weekly Hours Tracking Module

## Overview

The Employee Weekly Hours Tracking module is a comprehensive Odoo add-on designed to automatically monitor employee work hours, detect discrepancies between expected and logged hours, and notify managers when intervention may be needed. This module integrates seamlessly with Odoo's existing HR, Project, and Timesheet modules to provide real-time insights into workforce productivity and compliance.
